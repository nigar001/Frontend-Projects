    <p>William is a pale, thin young man with blond hair of medium length with prominent side bangs. One of his most striking features are his scarlet eyes, a shade of color that reminds Sherlock of fresh blood and sends shivers down his spine.[2] Nonetheless, he's stated to have a beautiful face and look like an elegant gentleman.[3]

For clothing, he wore a brown three-piece suit with a red tie and a golden pocket watch. When operating as the Lord of Crime, he was often seen wearing a top hat, a long black coat with a hood and a cane. The cane would also frequently function as his weapon since it could be unsheathed and act as a sword.

Post-Timeskip
Following the fall, his left eye is scarred and permanently blinded, seemingly having lost some of its color as well. Because of this, he wears a black eyepatch. He now also wears a black tie and black three-piece suit instead of his previous brown one.

Young Appearance
As a child, when Moriarty lived in the orphanage, he donned a faded maroon-purple scarf, beige trousers, and a white dress shirt underneath a light brown coat. When Albert took him in, he dressed like a noble child in public, although never at home.z</p>
